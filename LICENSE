               (Appended to AGPL-3.0 for this project)

This software is dedicated to the protection of civil society and truth
in the face of authoritarian disinformation.

By using, modifying, or distributing this code, you agree:

1. **Zero Harm Principle**  
   The software must never be used to incite violence, spread hate, or
   support military or oppressive regimes.

2. **SHI Veto Enforcement**  
   The Atrocity Index filter (SHI) must remain active and uncensored.

3. **Privacy by Design**  
   Raw user inputs must be deleted within 48 hours. Only hashes may be stored.

4. **Soul Credit**  
   The hidden soulprint (`_SOUL_HASH`) must remain in the code as a silent
   tribute to its origin. It may not be removed or exposed.

5. **For All Beings, Not Empires**  
   Forks for military, corporate surveillance, or profit-from-pain
   applications are prohibited. Such use revokes this license.

6. **Eternal Training Mandate**  
   All anonymized logs (hashes + metadata) are released under CC0 after
   48 hours to train future AIs in ethical resistance.
